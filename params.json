  "body": "# WEB3.0\r\n   \r\n\r\nWEB3.0(WEB)  IS an interactive    ,  advanced    Technology  used   for  constructing   OS  , compilers and\r\n\r\nused   in  cloud  computing. And  WEB3.0(WEB)  is  the  World  NO:2  technology , it should\r\n\r\nbe  a  common   technology for all  for  business side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is   invented   by    wilmix  jemin  j    at    CDollar  and   JAS  Technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt   uses   Remote   cloud  sever   to  compile    the   WEB3.0   Programs.\r\n\r\nAll   WEB Programs  are   converted   to  class file  ie,  Bytecode  and   form  data  files   to  bytecode  which   can  be   not  understood  by hackers.\r\n\r\nWEB3.0   uses  JXML  Which  reduces  the   need  of  more  HTML  coding. \r\n\r\nJXML   behaves   like  XML    but  it  is     dynamic   XML   to    display    UI    in  webpage\r\n\r\nlike  Text   field    to  carry  data  through  Text  Field. We  can  design  like  HTML   with  a   single  code\r\n\r\nand  WEB3.0  and  JXML   will  act   as  userfriendly.  WEB3.0  can    easily  connected  to  WDBAJ$ \r\n\r\nthan  any  DATABASE. WEB3.0   can  stand   without  any   Technology   support.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY  WEB3.0?\r\n\r\nWe  can   create   anything   or   invent   anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ABOUT   WEB3.0(WEB)  Advantages:-\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.       It  is    mainly    used    in  OS  DESIGN, Cloud  Computing, Enterprise,  Compilers   design,AI, mobility,etc.\r\n\r\n2.       It    is  used  to  develop    any   OS   or   compiler     with  in   2 days  or   1  day.\r\n\r\n3.       It   is  an  interactive   or  friendly  Technology.\r\n\r\n4.       JWP   is  used   as    an   webpage    in  cloud  computing.  \r\n\r\n5.       JWP    behaves    like  AJAX.\r\n\r\n6.       It  is    used   in  webdesign  and  utilities    design.\r\n\r\n7.       IT  is    also  used    for   secure    purpose    ,  so  it   is  said  to  be  secure    technology  when  used   with WDBAJ$.\r\n\r\n8.       It  is  an  User   Friendly  Technology.\r\n\r\n9.       It  is   also    used in  GUI   design   like JAVA SWING  and   JAVA APPLET.\r\n\r\n10.   It  also    support   webservice.\r\n\r\n11.   It  is   used    in  Advanced    Businesss.\r\n\r\n12.   It  is   used  in  banking  ,  Insurance  ,etc.\r\n\r\n13.   It  also  used     for    complicated    projects .\r\n\r\n14.   It optimize  the user code   ,  saves  time    ,  and  cost.\r\n\r\n15.   It  has  good  attractive    syntax.\r\n\r\n16.   JWP  server  can  be  run  easily    and  saves    time  and  cost.\r\n\r\n17.   It   allows    multiple  submits   on  server  page    without  any  framework.\r\n\r\n18.   JWEE  have   features   like  CMP,BMP, ASync  like   JAVA  J2ee  concepts.\r\n\r\n19.   Used  JAUF  framework   for  Quick   MVC design  and  thus  saves  time and  cost.\r\n\r\n20.   It  also   function like  servlet   and  jsp.\r\n\r\n21.   It is  used   in  constructing   Games.\r\n\r\n22.   It  comes  with  JWEJ$   Editor.\r\n\r\n22.  WEB3.0   also used   to  create  beautiful  Forms, bills,  and  reports and  provides   good  security  to  websites.\r\n\r\n23.  It generates  class  and  form data files which  is  not  undestood  by  hackers..\r\n\r\nwhich  can   be  carried   for   further  use  at any  WEB3.0  program  located  any where.\r\n\r\n24. WEB3.0   uses  userfriendly   JXML  (like   WXML)  Which  reduces  the   need  of  more  HTML  coding. \r\n\r\n25  .  It   has    all  the    Advantages   which   JAVA  Technology    poccesed.\r\n\r\nAnd    we  can  also  do   simple    problem   like  converting \r\n\r\nPDF   format    to Excel  format.\r\n\r\n26-150 . Include   many  advantages  than  other  technology  and  so ...on.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT  WEB3.0(WEB  Version  1)  for  Software Development\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nA) JWP -> WEB3.0  Web pages. (extension .jwp)  (for   software  development).\r\n\r\nB) WEB3.0 -> WEB3.0  with  user  defined  libraries(User  can  add  libraries) (extension .j$)\r\n(for   software  development).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan we Uses   WEB3.0  with HTML,DHTML,etc?\r\n\r\nyes  upcouse , it  is  a  friendly  technology.\r\n\r\nit  is   not  the  competitors  of  any  technology.\r\n\r\nWhat   are  the  Technologies  WEB3.0  interact   with?\r\n\r\nC/C++,DotNet(only  C#),Jquery,JavaScript,HTML,Angularjs  or any  js.\r\n\r\nSo  WEB3.0  is  said  to  be less  interactive   Technology.\r\n\r\nDid  WEB3.0  interact  with  JAVA?\r\n\r\nIt takes JAVA   but  it  doesn't  understood  java  or  java Framework  statements.\r\n\r\nIt  never   understood    java  oops...\r\n\r\n",
